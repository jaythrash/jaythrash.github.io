In this episode, I'm joined by Ashely Rodriguez of [Not Without Salt](http://notwithoutsalt.com "Not Without Salt"), an absolutely gorgeous website where she expertly combines three of my favorite subjects: food, family and photography.

Ashley and I discuss the importance of creativity in the kitchen, her food photography techniques, some great sources of inspiration for developing recipes, and finding joy in cooking for your family.
