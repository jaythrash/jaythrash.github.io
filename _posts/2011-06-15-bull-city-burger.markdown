[Bull City Burger & Brewery] is setting the new standard for burgers in Durham.  Not only are their burgers made from locally sourced, grass fed beef but the array of menu items made in house (sourced locally when possible) is simply staggering:beer, hotdogs, ketchup, pickles, buns, mayo, and aioli, just to name a few.

Give them a try next time you're in the area.  You wonâ€™t be disappointed.
