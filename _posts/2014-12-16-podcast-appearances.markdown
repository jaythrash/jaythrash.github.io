Over the past couple of months, I've had the pleasure of being the guest on a couple of great tech podcasts.

* [NSBrief Ep. 131](http://nsbrief.com/131-jay-thrash): [Recorded in the hallways] at 360iDev, Saul Mora was kind enough to invite me to join him for an episode where we discussed some of the ideas presented in my talk in more detail, despite the fact that I used singletons in one of my examples. 

* [iPhreaks Ep. 078](http://devchat.tv/iphreaks/078-iphreaks-show-skinny-controllers-with-jay-thrash): This opportunity came about as a result of my buddy [Alondo Brewington] who asked if I'd be interested in joining his fellow co-hosts of iPhreaks for an episode or two. In this first appearance, we had a lively discussion on the importance of reducing the complexity of your View Controllers and techniques for accomplishing that goal.
