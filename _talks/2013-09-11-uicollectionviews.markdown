Summary
-------
With the introduction of UICollectionView and its loyal sidekick, UICollectionViewLayout, iOS developers have been given an extremely powerful and infinitely customizable new way to present ordered data.

In this talk, we will discover how to leverage the hidden potential of UICollectionViews and UICollectionViewLayouts to break free of the grid and create unique and dynamic user interfaces.
