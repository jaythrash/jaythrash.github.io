> Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions.

[Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/) has done a great job creating [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), a set of complimenting light and dark color palettes for use within many popular code editors and terminal shells. I never thought Iâ€™d ever stray from my customized IR_Black TextMate theme, but having the ability to switch between a light and dark version of the same theme is incredibly useful when I want to work outdoors.
