Public speaking is an area that I've always considered myself to be a bit lacking. I've never taken one of those personality tests, but I'm pretty confident that I'd land on the mildly introverted side of the spectrum. Left to my own devices, I can very easily spend an entire workday without interacting with anyone verbally.

In an effort to break out of this self-built shell, I've been forcing myself to step outside my comfort zone and participate in several speaking engagements over the past year. Among these included [a][delegation] [few][viewcontrollers] [presentations][taming xcode] at my [local CocoaHeads chapter][Cocoaheads] and [multiple][pulled in] [guest][snakt] [appearances][dark knight] with [Jim Metzendorf] on [The Comic Shack] podcast. And even though I still haven't quite conquered the pre-flight jitters I feel before each of these talks, once they're over I'm always happy I participated and contributed.

An unintended side effect of these speaking engagements is that they've lead to some additional opportunities and projects I never would have considered a year ago. I'm *very* happy to announce two upcoming projects I'm extremely excited about:

- I've have accepted an invitation to be a speaker at [CocoaConf in Raleigh][cocoaconf] where I'll be presenting along with some amazing featured speakers like [Bill Dudney], [Aaron Hillegass], and [Daniel Steinberg].
- Last week, I launched my own podcast, [Sounds Delicious!], which will be a weekly interview show where we explore the topics relevant to the home cook and moving beyond the boundaries of the everyday cookbook. 

Am I nervous about being listed alongside some of the most well know Apple developers in the industry? *You bet.*

Do I realize that despite being pretty accomplished in the kitchen, I'm a complete newbie when it comes to producing a podcast? *Absolutely.*

It's still not easy for me to completely ignore all my [lizard brain] reservations, but thanks to a conversation I had with a very smart [Mann], I realized I don't have to. By setting them aside, ever so briefly, some pretty amazing things can happen.
