This past month, we changed the format of our monthly [Triangle CocoaHeads] meetings. Instead of having a primary presenter speak for an entire hour, we've broken it down into three, 30 minute slots covering the following areas: Cocoa Fundamentals, Cocoa Advanced, and Industry Talks/Design Talks/Dev Ops.

As one of the assistant organizers of the group, I figured I should get the ball rolling on this new format, and I offered myself up as the first guinea pig and gave a presentation on [Delegation vs. Notification].

My presentation was followed by [Using UIManagedDocument] by Alondo Brewing and [How to Get Your Dream Job] by Mike Hay. 

Based on the feedback we received after the meeting, it appears the new format was a great success.  Looking forward to keeping it going in our [May Meetup].
