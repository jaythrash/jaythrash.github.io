Another year, another blogging engine. For 2014, I've decided to set [Octopress](http://octopress.org) aside and experiment with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) instead. Similar to Octopress, Jekyll is a static site generator but it appears to be more actively maintained than Octopress.

I also took this opportunity to create a [Talks](/talks) page which consolidates the slides and recordings for the presentations I've given at development conferences and CocoaHead meetups over the past few years.
