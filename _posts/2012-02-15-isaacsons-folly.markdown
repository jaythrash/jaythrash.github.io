>Isaacson's book may well be the defining resource for Jobs's personal life â€” his childhood, his youth, his eccentricities, cruelty, temper, and emotional outbursts. But as regards Jobs's work, Isaacson leaves the reader profoundly and tragically misinformed.

John Gruber, [Daring Fireball: Walter Isaacson's 'Steve Jobs'][Gruber]

Given Isaacson's unprecedented access to Steve Jobs during his final days, it's quite a shame that the biography turned out to be so fundamentally flawed.
