It's quite obvious from my [Recommended page][1] that I'm a big fan of [Dan Benjamin's][2] [5by5 Network][3] of podcasts. On any given work day, I typically have the [5by5 Live Stream][4] running in the background while I bang away in Xcode.  

The recently released [5by5 Radio App][5] enhances the live listening experience by providing easy access to the live broadcast schedule and in-app notifications for when shows are going live.  During off-air moments, the app streams prior episodes via the "Best of 5by5" feed.

Highly recommended!
