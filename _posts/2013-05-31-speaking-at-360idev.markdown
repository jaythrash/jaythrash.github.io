I'm extremely happy to announce that I've been invited to speak at the [360iDev Developers Conference][360iDev] this fall in Denver! This will be my third time attending this conference since 2009, and will mark my first time attending as a speaker.

If you're thinking of going, I recommend [grabbing a ticket soon][360iDev Tickets] because it's sold out the last four years running!
