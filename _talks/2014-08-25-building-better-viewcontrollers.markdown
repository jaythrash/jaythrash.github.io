This presentation was originally given at [360iDev](http://360idev.com) in Denver, CO on August 25, 2014.

Summary
-------
When building iOS apps within the traditional MVC framework, View Controllers unfortunately bear the brunt of being the de facto dumping ground for all manner of disparate functionality. As a result, they are often the biggest and most convoluted files within our iOS projects.

But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this session, we will learn how to unburden our View Controllers by applying the Single Responsibility Principle and delegation through functional Intentions. We’ll find that by adopting the principles of “Lighter” View Controllers our code becomes much more robust to change, yet remains easy to maintain and test.

Video

I'll post a link to the video once it's made available at the 360iDev site.
