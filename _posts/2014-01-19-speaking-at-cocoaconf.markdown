Now that [CocoaConf 2014 Spring &amp; Summer tour dates][CocoaConf] have been posted, I'm very happy to announce that I've been invited to be a speaker when it [returns to Raleigh in May][CocoaConf Raleigh]! This will be my third time attending CocoaConf, and the second time as a speaker.

If you're thinking of going, I recommend [grabbing a ticket soon][CocoaConf Tickets] while the Early Bird discounts are still available.
