Presentation originally given at [CocoaConf Raleigh](http://cocoaconf.com/raleigh-2014/home) in Raleigh, NC on May 5, 2014.

Summary
-------
The Multipeer Connectivity framework included in iOS 7 represents a fundamental shift in how networked apps can be built. Using the Multipeer framework allows developers to tap into a wide range of nearby networking solutions like peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, infrastructure Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth personal area networks. However, as complicated as this all might sound, donâ€™t worry. The dirty details of all this infrastructure networking have been wrapped up within an API that's relatively compact, easy to understand and quite fun to use!
