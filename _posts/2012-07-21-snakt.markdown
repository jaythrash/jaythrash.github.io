As [episode 6 of The Comic Shack](http://5by5.tv/comicshack/6 "The Comic Shack, Episode 6") was wrapping up, Jim announced that the guest for the next episode would be none other than 5by5 host and Internet legend [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/ "Merlin Mann"). Later in the week, I jokingly mentioned to Jim via twitter that I'd be willing to forego a princely sum of money to simply sit in on the live recording. 

What I wasn't expecting at all was that Jim would invite me back to be a second guest alongside Merlin. Once I regained consciousness and pulled myself off the floor, I immediately accepted his offer.

The result of our conversation can be heard in the aptly named ["Snakt!"](http://5by5.tv/comicshack/7 "Snakt!") where we discussed the X-Men, Lee vs. Kirby, Merlin's public affections for Jean Grey, and our shared opinion that [Kurt Wagner, aka Nightcrawler](http://marvel.com/universe/Nightcrawler "Kurt Wagner, aka Nightcrawler"), would be a cool guy to hang out with.
