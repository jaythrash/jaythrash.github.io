Based on my post-meeting conversations, my [Unburdened ViewControllers][viewcontrollers] presentation for the [August Meetup] of the [Triangle CocoaHeads] seemed to have hit a nerve &mdash; which is good! Some of the large-scale iOS apps I've worked on have usually contained overly complex ViewControllers. This talk described a couple of strategies for delegating that complexity and so that your ViewControllers can focus on their original purpose of coordinating the flow of the application.
