For the [January Meetup] of the [Triangle CocoaHeads] I presented on the topic of [Prototyping with Origami]. [Origami] is a new toolkit for [Quartz Composer] that the Facebook Design Team recently released. 

If you tried using Quartz Composer in the past for prototyping and found it too cumbersome, I highly recommend you give it a second shot with Origami. The custom patches it provides better represent and encapsulate the patterns and interactions encountered in mobile UI designs, which makes the whole process significantly more streamlined.
