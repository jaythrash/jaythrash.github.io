## Fourth of July Watermelons, Two Ways

![Watermelon Margarita]

Watermelon season is in full swing here in North Carolina and I got my hands on a couple of great watermelons from our local farmers’ market.  Normally, I’m happy to just slice them open and have at ‘em, but I felt like trying something different for a recent dinner party.

Here are the two applications I finally settled on; one for the kids and another for the adults.

### Watermelon-Basil Water (aka Agua Fresca) 

Source: Fine Cooking, May 2011 

* 1/4 cup lightly packed fresh basil leaves
* 1 Tbs. granulated sugar
* 1 cup boiling water
* 4 cups cubed seedless watermelon (1 lb.)
* 2 Tbs. fresh lime juice

Put the basil leaves and sugar in a small pot and crush the leaves with a wooden spoon. Pour in the boiling water and stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to steep and cool for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a blender, purée the watermelon with 2 cups cold water. Strain the watermelon liquid and basil liquid through a fine strainer into a large bowl; discard the solids. Pour the liquid into a large pitcher. Add the lime juice and 2 cups cold water; stir to combine. Serve over ice.

### Watermelon Margaritas

* 2 oz Lime Juice
* 1 tsp Sugar
* Muddle and transfer to mixing glass
* fill with ice
* 1 1/2 oz Tequila
* 1/4 oz Orange Liqueur
* Shake
* Strain into a chilled cocktail glass
