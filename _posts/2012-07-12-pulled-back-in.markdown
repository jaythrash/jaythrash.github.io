As a recovering comic book collector and long time listener of the [5by5 Network], I was excited and honored when [Jim Metzendorf] invited me to join him on this week's episode of [The Comic Shack]. In this episode, we covered my comic book collecting "origin story", how I wandered away from comics, and the series of events that got me interested in collecting again.
 
Despite this being my first time participating in a podcast (please excuse all the "umms", "you-knows", and referring to Joss Whedon as "Josh"), Jim did a great job of making me feel comfortable and guiding the conversation.
