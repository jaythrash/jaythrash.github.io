Zach Holman:

> Public speaking is tough. Be it at a conference, or during a company meeting, or in your car trying to persuade the cop not to ticket you for going three times the speed limit while streaming an episode of The Maury Povich Show on your iPad, talking in front of other people can be an intimidating experience.

At [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io), [Zach](http://zachholman.com) as collected some of the best information I've seen on planning, preparing, and delivering a public presentation. Whether you're presenting to hundreds at a conference, a small local user's group, or to your team at work, you'll certainly improve your chances at success by following the advice of someone who's done his [fair share of talks](http://zachholman.com/talks).
