I'm Jay Thrash and I'm a software developer who spends most of his time these days building iOS apps for the iPhone and iPad.  In the event I need to build a website, Ruby on Rails is my framework of choice. 

Throughout my career, I've created applications for a variety of platforms and operating systems but none of them ever generated the sense of fascination and excitement as I feel when I'm crafting iOS applications.  As such, I consider myself quite fortunate that my career has led me to a point where I can make a living developing for the iOS platform and its amazing devices.

I'm always looking for opportunities and events where I can share what I've learned with fellow developers. If you would like me to speak at your event, please contact via email â€“ you can reach me at *jay at jaythrash.com*, or [@jaythrash on twitter](http://twitter.com/jaythrash).

If my coffee mug within reach, it's typically filled with an amazing *locally* roasted coffee from [Larry's Beans](http://www.larrysbeans.com) or [Counter Culture](http://counterculturecoffee.com) and was brewed using an [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK) or my reliable [Cuisinart DCC-1200](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DCC-1200-Central-Programmable-Coffeemaker/dp/B00005IBX9).

I'm not a heavy user of Twitter, but I can be found there under the cleverly original handle of [@jaythrash](http://twitter.com/jaythrash).
