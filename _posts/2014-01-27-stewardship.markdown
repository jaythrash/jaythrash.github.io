Mattt Thompson:

> In terms of open source participation, releasing code is only one aspectâ€”and arguably not even the most important one. Developing an open source project requires equal parts engineering, product design, communication, and community management. But the true deciding factor for whether an open source project succeeds is stewardship.

The Internet is rife with Open Source projects that launched with great enthusiasm, but were left to wither on the vine.  In another great NSHipster article, Mattt (yes, that's the correct spelling!) explains how the role of stewardship is the vital component of creating a successful open source project.
