For the [May Meetup] of the [Triangle CocoaHeads] I presented on the topic of [Interaction Prototyping with Quartz Composer].  This presentation was heavily influenced by a [recent series of Quartz Composer tutorials][Dave OBrien] by Dave O'Brien where he methodically recreated elements of the new Facebook Home interface using [Quartz Composer].
