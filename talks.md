I consider myself quite fortunate that my career has led me to a point where I can make a living developing iOS applications; but not simply because I enjoy using the amazing devices the platform powers, but because of the incredible development community that has embraced it.

As a way of paying it forward, I'm always looking for opportunities and events where I can share what I've learned with fellow developers. The venues were I've been honored to present include: [360iDev](http://360idev.com), [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com), and my [local CocoaHeads chapter](http://www.meetup.com/nscoderrtp/).

If you would like me to speak at your event, please contact via email â€“ you can reach me at *jay at jaythrash.com*, or [@jaythrash on twitter](http://twitter.com/jaythrash).
